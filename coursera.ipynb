    "    What you will do:\n",
    "    - Create an empty bank dictionary.\n",

    "    - If the key does exist in the dictionary, increment its value with the amount.\n",
    "    - You should also handle the following cases:\n",
    "    -- When the value is missing or invalid.  If so, ignore that line and don't update the dictionary.\n",
    "    -- When the line is completely blank.  Again, ignore that line and don't update the dictionary.\n",
